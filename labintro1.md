# Developing Cloud-Native Applications Using Microsoft Azure Cosmos - Explore Azure Cosmos DB   

### Overall Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to provision and use Azure Cosmos DB to store non-relational data. You will create a Cosmos DB account, set up a sample database, interact with data by viewing and creating items, and perform queries to explore its capabilities.

## Objective

Equip participants with the skills to provision and manage an Azure Cosmos DB database for storing non-relational data. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Explore Azure Cosmos DB:** The objective of this lab is to enable participants to provision and manage an Azure Cosmos DB database, store non-relational data, and explore its capabilities through creating, managing, and querying a sample database.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Azure Platform Understanding:** Basic knowledge of Azure services, including Azure Cosmos DB.

## Architechture

This architecture illustrates the process of provisioning and using Azure Cosmos DB for managing non-relational data. In this lab, the user will walk through creating a Cosmos DB account, setting up a sample database, interacting with data by viewing and creating items, and performing queries to explore its capabilities. This lab provides a foundational understanding of using Azure Cosmos DB to store and manage non-relational data efficiently.
