# Create and update documents with the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API SDK

## Lab scenario

The [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container] class includes a set of member methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete items within an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container. Together, these methods perform some of the most common “CRUD” operations across various items within NoSQL API containers.

In this lab, you’ll use the SDK to perform everyday CRUD operations on an item within an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Create an Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API account.
- Task 2: Connect to the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API account from the SDK.
- Task 3: Perform create and read point operations on items with the SDK.
- Task 4: Perform update and delete point operations with the SDK.

## Estimated Timing: 60 minutes

### Task 1: Create an Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API account

Azure Cosmos DB is a cloud-based NoSQL database service that supports multiple APIs. When provisioning an Azure Cosmos DB account for the first time, you will select which of the APIs you want the account to support (for example, **Mongo API** or **SQL API**). Once the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account is done provisioning, you can retrieve the endpoint and key and use them to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account using the Azure SDK for .NET or any other SDK of your choice.

1. Inside the LabVM, double-click on the **Azure Portal** shortcut.

    <validation step="185fcc24-d57e-4db3-a26d-1b9d4b61dbf2" />

### Task 2: Connect to the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API account from the SDK

Using the credentials from the newly created account, you will connect with the SDK classes and create a new database and container instance. Then, you will use the Data Explorer to validate that the instances exist in the Azure portal.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **06-sdk-crud** folder.

1. Open the context menu for the **06-sdk-crud** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

    >**Note**: This command will open the terminal with the starting directory already set to the **06-sdk-crud** folder.

1. Add the [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos][nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.cosmos/3.22.1] package from NuGet using the following command:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos --version 3.22.1
    ```

1. Build the project using the [dotnet build][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build] command:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Close the integrated terminal.

1. Open the **script.cs** code file within the **06-sdk-crud** folder.

    >**Note**: The **[Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos][nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.cosmos/3.22.1]** library has already been pre-imported from NuGet.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **endpoint**. Set its value to the **endpoint** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.
  
    ```
    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    ```

    >**Note**: For example, if your endpoint is: **https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/**, then the C# statement would be: **string endpoint = "https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/";**.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **key**. Set its value to the **key** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.

    ```
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";
    ```

    >**Note**: For example, if your key is: **fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==**, then the C# statement would be: **string key = "fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==";**.

1. Asynchronously invoke the CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync method of the **client** variable passing in the name of the new database (**cosmicworks**) you would like to create, and store the result in a variable of type **Database**:

    ```
    Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("cosmicworks");
    ```

1. Asynchronously invoke the **CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync** method of the **database** variable passing in the name of the new container (**products**), the partition key path (**/categoryId**), and the throughput (**400**) you would like to create within the **cosmicworks** database and storing the result in a variable of type **Container**:
  
    ```
    Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("products", "/categoryId", 400);    
    ```

1. Once you are done, your code file should now include:
  
    ```
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";

    CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
    
    Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("cosmicworks");
    
    Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("products", "/categoryId", 400);
    ```

1. **Save** the **script.cs** code file.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the context menu for the **06-sdk-crud** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. Build and run the project using the [dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run] command:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Close the integrated terminal.

1. Navigate to the **Azure portal**.

1. Select **Resource groups**, then select the resource group you created or viewed earlier in this lab, and then select the **Azure Cosmos DB account** resource you created in this lab.

1. Within the **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource, navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer**, expand the **cosmicworks** database node, then observe the new **products** container node within the **NoSQL API** navigation tree.

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
    > - Navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
    > - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.

    <validation step="efd4c72c-608a-423e-97eb-a3700baca703" />

### Task 3: Perform create and read point operations on items with the SDK

You will now use the set of asynchronous methods in the Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container class to perform common operations on items within a NoSQL API container. These operations are all done using the task asynchronous programming model in C#.

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**. Open the **product.cs** code file within the **06-sdk-crud** folder.

    >**Note**: Do not close the editor for the **script.cs** file.

1. Observe the **Product** class within this code file. This class represents a product item that will be stored and manipulated within this container.

1. Return to the editor tab for the **script.cs** code file.

1. Create a new object of type **Product** named **saddle** with the following properties:

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **id** | *706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009* |
    | **categoryId** | *9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816* |
    | **name** | *Road Saddle* |
    | **price** | *45.99d* |
    | **tags** | *{ tan, new, crisp }* |

    ```
    Product saddle = new()
    {
        id = "706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009",
        categoryId = "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816",
        name = "Road Saddle",
        price = 45.99d,
        tags = new string[]
        {
            "tan",
            "new",
            "crisp"
        }
    };
    ```

1. Asynchronously invoke the generic [CreateItemAsync<>][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container.createitemasync] method of the **container** variable passing in the **saddle** variable as the method parameter and using **Product** as the generic type:

    ```
    await container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
    ```

1. Once you are done, your code file should now include:
  
    ```
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";

    CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
    
    Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("cosmicworks");
    
    Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("products", "/categoryId", 400);

    Product saddle = new()
    {
        id = "706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009",
        categoryId = "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816",
        name = "Road Saddle",
        price = 45.99d,
        tags = new string[]
        {
            "tan",
            "new",
            "crisp"
        }
    };

    await container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
    ```

1. **Save** the **script.cs** code file.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the context menu for the **06-sdk-crud** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. Build and run the project using the **[dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run]** command:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Close the integrated terminal.

1. Return to the editor tab for the **script.cs** code file.

1. Delete the following lines of code:

    ```
    Product saddle = new()
    {
        id = "706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009",
        categoryId = "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816",
        name = "Road Saddle",
        price = 45.99d,
        tags = new string[]
        {
            "tan",
            "new",
            "crisp"
        }
    };

    await container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
    ```

1. Create a string variable named **id** with a value of **706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009**:

    ```
    string id = "706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009";
    ```

1. Create a string variable named **categoryId** with a value of **9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816**:

    ```
    string categoryId = "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816";
    ```

1. Create a variable of type [PartitionKey][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.partitionkey] named **partitionKey** passing in the **categoryId** variable as a constructor parameter:

    ```
    PartitionKey partitionKey = new (categoryId);
    ```

1. Asynchronously invoke the generic [ReadItemAsync<>][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container.readitemasync] method of the **container** variable passing in the **id** and **partitionkey** variables as method parameters, using **Product** as the generic type, and storing the result in a variable named **saddle** of type **Product**:

    ```
    Product saddle = await container.ReadItemAsync<Product>(id, partitionKey);
    ```

1. Invoke the static **Console.WriteLine** method to print the saddle object using a formatted output string:

    ```
    Console.WriteLine($"[{saddle.id}]\t{saddle.name} ({saddle.price:C})");
    ```

1. Once you are done, your code file should now include:
  
    ```
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";

    CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
    
    Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("cosmicworks");
    
    Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("products", "/categoryId", 400);

    string id = "706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009";

    string categoryId = "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816";
    PartitionKey partitionKey = new (categoryId);

    Product saddle = await container.ReadItemAsync<Product>(id, partitionKey);

1. Observe the output from the terminal. Specifically, observe the formatted output text with the ID, name, and price of the item.

1. Close the integrated terminal.

### Task 4: Perform update and delete point operations with the SDK

While learning the SDK, it's not uncommon to use an online Azure Cosmos DB SDK account or the emulator to update an item and  oscillate back and forth between the Data Explorer and your IDE of choice as you perform an operation and check to see if your change has been applied. Here, you will do just that as you update and delete an item using the SDK.

1. Navigate to the **Azure portal**.

1. Select **Resource groups**, then select the resource group you created or viewed earlier in this lab, and then select the **Azure Cosmos DB account** resource you created in this lab.

1. Within the **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource, navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer**, expand the **cosmicworks** database node, then expand the new **products** container node within the **NoSQL API** navigation tree.

1. Select the **Items** node. Select the only item within the container and then observe the values of the **name** and **price** properties of the item.

    | **Property** | **Value** |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Name** | *Road Saddle* |
    | **Price** | *$45.99* |

    >**Note**: At this point, these values should not have been changed since you created the item. You will change these values in this exercise.

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**. Return to the editor tab for the **script.cs** code file.

1. Delete the following lines of code:

    ```
    Console.WriteLine($"[{saddle.id}]\t{saddle.name} ({saddle.price:C})");
    ```

1. Change the **saddle** variable by setting the value of the price property to **32.55**:

    ```
    saddle.price = 32.55d;
    ```

1. Modify the **saddle** variable again by setting the value of the **name** property to **Road LL Saddle**:

    ```
    saddle.name = "Road LL Saddle";
    ```

1. Asynchronously invoke the generic [UpsertItemAsync<>][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container.upsertitemasync] method of the **container** variable passing in the **saddle** variable as the method parameter and using **Product** as the generic type:

    ```
    await container.UpsertItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
    ```

1. Once you are done, your code file should now include:
  
    ```
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";

    CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
    
    Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("cosmicworks");
    
    Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("products", "/categoryId", 400);

    string id = "706cd7c6-db8b-41f9-aea2-0e0c7e8eb009";

    string categoryId = "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816";
    PartitionKey partitionKey = new (categoryId);

    Product saddle = await container.ReadItemAsync<Product>(id, partitionKey);

    saddle.price = 32.55d;
    saddle.name = "Road LL Saddle";
    
    await container.UpsertItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
    ```

1. In the **Data Explorer**, expand the **cosmicworks** database node, then expand the new **products** container node within the **NoSQL API** navigation tree.

1. Select the **Items** node. Select the only item within the container and then observe the values of the **name** and **price** properties of the item.

    | **Property** | **Value** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Name** | *Road LL Saddle* |
    | **Price** | *$32.55* |

    >**Note**: At this point, these values should  have been changed since you have observed the item.

1. Close your web browser window or tab.

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**. Return to the editor tab for the **script.cs** code file.

1. Delete the following lines of code:

    ```
    Product saddle = await container.ReadItemAsync<Product>(id, partitionKey);

    saddle.price = 32.55d;
    saddle.name = "Road LL Saddle";
    
    await container.UpsertItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
    ```

1. Asynchronously invoke the generic [DeleteItemAsync<>][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container.deleteitemasync] method of the **container** variable passing in the **id** and **partitionkey** variables as method parameters and using **Product** as the generic type:

    ```
