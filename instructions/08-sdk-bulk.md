# Move multiple documents in bulk with the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL SDK

## Lab scenario

The easiest way to learn how to perform a bulk operation is to attempt to push many documents to an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account in the cloud. Using the bulk features of the SDK, this can be done with some minor help from the [System.Threading.Tasks][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks] namespace.

In this lab, you'll use the [Bogus][nuget.org/packages/bogus/33.1.1] library from NuGet to generate fictional data and place that into an Azure Cosmos DB account.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Create an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account and configure the SDK project.
- Task 2: Bulk inserting twenty-five thousand documents.
- Task 3: Observe the results.

## Estimated Timing: 30 minutes

        ![06](media/06.png)
  
1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, click No

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** window appears, click **cancel** to skip the tour.

1. Select **+ Create a resource**, search for *Cosmos DB*, select **Azure Cosmos DB**.

1. Select **Create** under **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**. Then create a new **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** account resource with the following settings, leaving all remaining settings to their default values, and select **Review + create**:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Subscription** | *Your existing Azure subscription* |
    | **Resource group** | *Select an existing Cosmosdb-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>* |
    | **Account Name** | *sql-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>* |
    | **Location** | *Choose any available region* |
    | **Capacity mode** | *Provisioned throughput* |
    | **Apply Free Tier Discount** | *Do Not Apply* |
    | **Limit the total amount of throughput that can be provisioned on this account** | *Unchecked* |
   
1. Wait for the deployment task to complete before continuing with this task.

1. Go to the newly created **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource and navigate to the **Keys** pane.

1. This pane contains the connection details and credentials necessary to connect to the account from the SDK. Specifically:

    1. Notice the **URI** field. You will use this **endpoint** value later in this exercise.

    1. Notice the **PRIMARY KEY** field. You will use this **key** value later in this exercise.

1. On the **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource, navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer**, select **New Container**, and then create a new container with the following settings, leaving all remaining settings to their default values and click **OK**.

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Database id** | *Create new* &vert; *`cosmicworks`* |
    | **Share throughput across containers** | *Unchecked* |
    | **Container id** | *`products`* |
    | **Partition key** | *`/categoryId`* |
    | **Container throughput** | *Autoscale* &vert; *`4000`* |

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**.. 

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **08-sdk-bulk** folder.

1. Open the **script.cs** code file within the **08-sdk-bulk** folder.

    >**Note**: The **[Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos][nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.cosmos/3.22.1]** library has already been pre-imported from NuGet.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **endpoint**. Set its value to the **endpoint** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created in the previous lab.
  
    ```
    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    ```

    >**Note**: For example, if your endpoint is: **https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/**, then the C# statement would be: **string endpoint = "https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/";**.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **key**. Set its value to the **key** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created in the previous lab.

    ```
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";
    ```

    >**Note**: For example, if your key is: **fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==**, then the C# statement would be: **string key = "fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==";**.

1. Press **Ctrl+S** to **Save** the script.cs code file.

1. Open the context menu for the **08-sdk-bulk** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

    >**Note**: This command will open the terminal with the starting directory already set to the **08-sdk-bulk** folder.

1. Add the [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos][nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.cosmos/3.22.1] package from NuGet using the following command:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos --version 3.22.1
    ```

1. Build the project using the [dotnet build][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build] command:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Close the integrated terminal.

### Task 2: Bulk inserting twenty-five thousand documents

Let's "go for the gusto" and try to insert a lot of documents to see how this works. In our internal testing, this can take approximately 1-2 minutes if the lab virtual machine and Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API account are relatively close to each other geographically speaking.

1. Return to the editor tab for the **script.cs** code file.

1. Create a new instance of the [CosmosClientOptions][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions] named **options** class with the **AllowBulkExecution** property set to a value of **true**:

    ```
    CosmosClientOptions options = new () 
    { 
        AllowBulkExecution = true 
    };
    ```

1. Create a new instance of the **CosmosClient** class named **client** passing in the **endpoint**, **key**, and **options** variables as constructor parameters:

    ```
    CosmosClient client = new (endpoint, key, options); 
    ```

1. Use the [GetContainer][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclient.getcontainer] method of the **client** variable to retrieve the existing container using the name of the database (*cosmicworks*) and the name of the container (*products*):

    ```
    Container container = client.GetContainer("cosmicworks", "products");
    ```

1. Use this special sample code to generate **25,000** fictitious products using the **Faker** class from the Bogus library imported from NuGet.

    ```
    List<Product> productsToInsert = new Faker<Product>()
        .StrictMode(true)
        .RuleFor(o => o.id, f => Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
        .RuleFor(o => o.name, f => f.Commerce.ProductName())
        .RuleFor(o => o.price, f => Convert.ToDouble(f.Commerce.Price(max: 1000, min: 10, decimals: 2)))
        .RuleFor(o => o.categoryId, f => f.Commerce.Department(1))
        .Generate(25000);
    ```

    >**Note**: The [Bogus][nuget.org/packages/bogus/33.1.1] library is an open-source library used to design fictitious data to test user interface applications and is great for learning how to develop bulk import/export applications.

1. Create a new generic **List<>** of type **Task** named **concurrentTasks**:

    ```
    List<Task> concurrentTasks = new List<Task>();
    ```

1. Create a for-each loop that will iterate over the list of products that was generated earlier in this application:

    ```
    foreach(Product product in productsToInsert)
    {
    }
    ```

1. Within the for-each loop, create a **Task** to asynchronously insert a product into Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API being sure to explicitly specify the partition key and to add the task to a list of tasks named **concurrentTasks**:

    ```
    concurrentTasks.Add(
        container.CreateItemAsync(product, new PartitionKey(product.categoryId))
    );   
    ```

1. After the foreach loop, asynchronously await the result of **Task.WhenAll** on the **concurrentTasks** variable:

    ```
    await Task.WhenAll(concurrentTasks);
    ```

1. Use the built-in **Console.WriteLine** static method to print a static message of **Bulk tasks complete** to the console:

    ```
    Console.WriteLine("Bulk tasks complete");
    ```

1. Once you are done, your code file should now include:
  
    ```
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Bogus;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
    
    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";
    
    CosmosClientOptions options = new () 
    { 
        AllowBulkExecution = true 
    };
    
    CosmosClient client = new (endpoint, key, options);  
    
    Container container = client.GetContainer("cosmicworks", "products");
    
    List<Product> productsToInsert = new Faker<Product>()
        .StrictMode(true)
        .RuleFor(o => o.id, f => Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
        .RuleFor(o => o.name, f => f.Commerce.ProductName())
        .RuleFor(o => o.price, f => Convert.ToDouble(f.Commerce.Price(max: 1000, min: 10, decimals: 2)))
        .RuleFor(o => o.categoryId, f => f.Commerce.Department(1))
        .Generate(25000);
        
    List<Task> concurrentTasks = new List<Task>();
    
    foreach(Product product in productsToInsert)
    {    
        concurrentTasks.Add(
            container.CreateItemAsync(product, new PartitionKey(product.categoryId))
        );
    }
    
    await Task.WhenAll(concurrentTasks);   

    Console.WriteLine("Bulk tasks complete");
    ```

1. Press **Ctrl+S** to **Save** the script.cs code file.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the context menu for the **08-sdk-bulk** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. Build and run the project using the **[dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run]** command:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. The application should run silently, it should take approximately one to two minutes to run before completing silently.

1. Close the integrated terminal.

1. Close **Visual Studio Code**.

### Task 3: Observe the results

Now that you have sent 25,000 items to Azure Cosmos DB let’s go and look at the Data Explorer.

1. In a web browser, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Select **Resource groups**, then select the resource group you created or viewed earlier in this lab, and then select the **Azure Cosmos DB account** resource you created in this lab.

1. Within the **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource, navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer**, expand the **cosmicworks** database node, then observe the **products** container node within the **NoSQL API** navigation tree.

1. Expand the **products** node, and then select the **Items** node. Observe the list of items within your container.

1. Select the **products** container node within the **NoSQL API** navigation tree, and click on **...** then select **New SQL Query**.

1. Delete the contents of the editor area.

1. Create a new SQL query that will return a count of all documents created using the bulk operation:

    ```
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM items
    ```

1. Select **Execute Query**.

1. Observe the count of the items in your container.

1. Close your web browser window or tab.
