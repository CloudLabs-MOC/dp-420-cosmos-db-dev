# Lab 01: Explore Azure Cosmos DB

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you'll provision an Azure Cosmos DB database in your Azure subscription, and explore the various ways you can use it to store non-relational data.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Cosmos DB account
+ Task 2: Create a sample database
+ Task 3: View and create items
+ Task 4: Query the database

## Estimated timing: 15 minutes

### Exercise 1: Explore Azure Cosmos DB

To use Cosmos DB, you must provision a Cosmos DB account in your Azure subscription. In this exercise, you'll provision a Cosmos DB account that uses the core (SQL) API.

#### Task 1: Create a Cosmos DB account

1.  In the Azure portal, select  **+ Create a resource** (1)  at the top left, and search for  **Azure Cosmos DB** (2). In the results, select  **Azure Cosmos DB** (3) and select  **Create** (4).

2.  In the  **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**  tile, select  **Create**.

3.  Enter the following details, and then select  **Review + Create**:
    -   **Subscription**: Select your **Azure subscription.**
    -   **Resource group**: Select existing resource group **DP-900-Module-3-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    -   **Account Name**: Enter **cosmosdb-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    -   **Location**: Choose any available location
    -   **Capacity mode**: Provisioned throughput
    -   **Apply Free-Tier Discount**: Select Apply
    -   **Limit total account throughput**: Unselected

4.  When the configuration has been validated, select  **Create**.

5.  Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed resource.

### Task 2 : Create a sample database

*Throughout this procedure, close any tips that are displayed in the portal*.

1. On the page for your new Cosmos DB account, in the pane on the left, select **Data Explorer**.
1. In the **Data Explorer** page, select **Launch quick start**.
1. In the **New container** tab, review the pre-populated settings for the sample database, and then select **OK**.
1. Observe the status in the panel at the bottom of the screen until the **SampleDB** database and its **SampleContainer** container has been created (which may take a minute or so).

### Task 3 : View and create items

1.  In the Data Explorer page, expand the  **SampleDB**  database and the **SampleContainer**, and select  **Items**  to see a list of items in the container. The items represent people, each with a unique id, a first name, an age, and other properties.

2.  Select any of the items in the list to see a JSON representation of the item data.

3.  At the top of the page, select  **New Item**  to create a new blank item.

4.  Modify the JSON for the new item as follows, and then select  **Save**.

    
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Road Helmet,45",
        "id": "123456789",
        "categoryID": "123456789",
        "SKU": "AB-1234-56",
        "description": "The product called \"Road Helmet,45\" ",
        "price": 48.74
    }
    ```
    
5.  After saving the new item, notice that additional metadata properties are added automatically.

### Task 4  : Query the database

1.  In the  **Data Explorer**  page, select the  **New SQL Query**  icon.

2.  In the SQL Query editor, review the default query (`SELECT * FROM c`) and use the  **Execute Query**  button to run it.

3.  Review the results, which includes the full JSON representation of all items.

4.  Modify the query as follows:
   
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM c
    WHERE CONTAINS(c.name,"Helmet")
    ```

5. Use the **Execute Query** button to run the revised query and review the results, which includes JSON entities for any items with a **name** field containing the text "Helmet".
    
6.  Close the SQL Query editor, discarding your changes.
    
    >**Note**: You've seen how to create and query JSON entities in a Cosmos DB database by using the data explorer interface in the Azure portal. In a real scenario, an application developer would use one of the many programming language specific software development kits (SDKs) to call the core (SQL) API and work with data in the database.
